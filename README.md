HOW TO USE:
Step 1: Clone the Git repository or download the source code
Step 1.5 (SOURCE CODE): Extract the code
Step 2: Go to 'flash.py' and execute it by clicking on it.
Step 2.5 (CMD_LINE): If you are on a command line, change the directory (cd) to where the file is, then type 'py' or 'python' and type the name of the file, which would be: "flash.py"
Step 3 (ISSUES): If this is not executable, you can make it executable.

LINUX USERS, LOOK HERE. IF YOU ARE A WINDOWS USER, LOOK FURTHER.

Change the directory (cd), then type: 'chmod +x flash.py'
WINDOWS USERS, LOOK HERE:

Open a command prompt (CMD) or PowerShell window.
Navigate to the directory where the 'flash.py' file is located using the 'cd' command (change directory). For example:
FOR SHELLCMD
---------------------
cd path\to\directory
---------------------
Once you are in the correct directory, you can execute the Flash shell script using the 'python' command:
----------------
python flash.py
----------------
Note: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. If not, you can download and install it from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/downloads/).

A standalone will be made when it releases. (MACOS AND WINDOWS) For Linux, you will have to wait a little.
